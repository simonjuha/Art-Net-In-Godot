# Art-Net simulation in Godot
I was wondering if Godot would be a nice tool for simulating DMX lighting, so i made some script for this prupose.
use connect on an _ArtNet_ instance to get updated DMX frames. All _DmxFixture_ in a scene is automaticly added to the _ArtNet_ class through a group called 'dmx_fixtures'
